<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li>A branch should only focus on one task. Either complete it in one go, or create a new branch.</li>
  <li>Always remember to write tests. Unit tests, integration tests, automated tests.</li>
  <li>When reading code, go line by line, making sure you understand what each line does before moving on. Don’t skim through it.</li>
  <li>Whenever you complete a stage, remember to push your changes.</li>
  <li>Keep your temper in check. It's not about swallowing your anger, but about understanding the situation first.</li>
  <li>If you’ve made a decision but find that no matter what you do, it’s not going smoothly, stop immediately. Trust your instincts at that point.</li>
</ul>
